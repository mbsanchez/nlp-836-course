the au wa origin defin as the length of the semi-major axi of the earth's ellipt orbit around the sun. in 1976 the intern astronom union revis the definit of the au for greater precis, defin it as that length for which the gaussian gravit constant (k) take the valu 0.017 202 098 95 when the unit of measur ar the astronom unit of length, mass and time.[5][6][7] an equival definit is the radiu of an unperturb circular newtonian orbit about the sun of a particl have infinitesim mass, move with an angular frequenc of 0.017 202 098 95 radian per dai,[2] or that length for which the heliocentr gravit constant (the product gm) is equal to (0.017 202 098 95)2 au3/d2. it is approxim equal to the mean earth-sun distanc.
